Today I focused on databases and analytics in AWS, and it pushed me to think less about services and more about cloud architecture.

I built a relational database using Amazon RDS, created a snapshot for backup and disaster recovery, and explored deployment strategies like Read Replicas, Multi-AZ, and Multi-Region to understand how high availability is designed in real-world systems.

I also created a DynamoDB table, inserted data, and gained clarity on when to choose SQL vs NoSQL depending on scalability, performance, and application design.

Beyond the hands-on work, I explored analytics and specialized databases including Redshift, EMR, Athena, Glue, QuickSight, Neptune, and Timestream.

Big realization:
Cloud engineering is not about memorizing services it is about designing systems that are resilient, scalable, and fault tolerant.

One step closer to becoming a Cloud Engineer.

On to the next build.
