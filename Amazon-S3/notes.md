Today’s learning session was all about Amazon S3, and it helped me understand how cloud storage actually works in real life.

I learned the core concepts of S3 buckets and objects, then went deeper into S3 security including IAM policies, S3 bucket policies, and encryption. This made it clear how access control and data protection are handled in AWS.
I also hosted a static website on Amazon S3, which was exciting to see live using just a bucket and configuration.

Versioning was another big highlight. I used it to manage multiple versions of files, prevent accidental deletes, and restore previous versions all applied directly to my static website and uploaded files.

Beyond that, I learned about:
◾ S3 Replication (same-region and cross-region)
◾ S3 Storage Classes and when to use each
◾ AWS Snowball for large data transfers
◾ AWS Storage Gateway for hybrid storage solutions

I did hands-on practice creating:
◾ S3 buckets
◾ Bucket policies
◾ Versioning
◾ Replication rules
◾ Storage class configurations

This module really showed me how scalable, secure, and flexible cloud storage can be. Still learning, still building, and documenting the journey as I go.
