Today I explored AWS Compute Services beyond EC2, and it shifted my perspective from simply running servers to building event-driven and containerized architectures.

I worked through services such as Docker, Amazon ECS, AWS Fargate, Amazon ECR, AWS Batch, and Amazon Lightsail, gaining a clearer understanding of how modern applications are deployed and managed at scale.

The highlight of today’s hands-on session was AWS Lambda.
I created a Lambda function using the Python Hello World blueprint and configured a test event to trigger it successfully. Seeing code execute without provisioning a server reinforced how powerful serverless architecture can be for scalability and cost efficiency.

Key takeaway:
Cloud engineering is increasingly moving toward automation, containers, and serverless design rather than manual infrastructure management.

One more step toward designing efficient and resilient cloud systems. On to the next build 🚀
